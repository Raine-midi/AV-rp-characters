A lot of social media platforms can display a rich preview for your website when sharing a link (most notably, a cover image, a title and a description).

Quartz can also dynamically generate and use new cover images for every page to be used in link previews on social media for you.

## Showcase

After enabling the [[docs/plugins/CustomOgImages]] emitter plugin, the social media link preview for [[authoring content \| Authoring Content]] looks like this:

| Light                               | Dark                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ![[docs/images/social-image-preview-light.png]] | ![[docs/images/social-image-preview-dark.png]] |

## Configuration

This functionality is provided by the [[docs/plugins/CustomOgImages]] plugin. See the plugin page for customization options.
