Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers are [[docs/showcase\|already using Quartz]] to publish personal notes, websites, and [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) to the web.

## ðŸª´ Get Started

Quartz requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v22** and `npm` v10.9.2 to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.

Then, in your terminal of choice, enter the following commands line by line:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
npm i
npx quartz create
```

This will guide you through initializing your Quartz with content. Once you've done so, see how to:

1. [[docs/authoring content\|Writing content]] in Quartz
2. [[docs/configuration\|Configure]] Quartz's behaviour
3. Change Quartz's [[docs/layout]]
4. [[docs/build\|Build and preview]] Quartz
5. Sync your changes with [[docs/setting up your GitHub repository\|GitHub]]
6. [[docs/hosting\|Host]] Quartz online
